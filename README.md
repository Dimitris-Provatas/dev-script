# Dev Script
A script for zsh to open projects fast and easy in your favourite IDE

## Fast, Simple and Efficient
The Dev Script is just a simple shell script. It was designed to allow multi-project developers to access them as fast and easy as possible.
The idea behind it is to type the least amount of things to open the IDE as fast as possible and be ready for productivity.

### Any help is welcome
I did this in one afternoon, by no means it is a great solution. This is just a start to try and get as far as possible.
If you have a feature idea, a good optimization or any refactoring to make the script cleaner, don't hesitate to make a pull request.
Any help is welcome!
